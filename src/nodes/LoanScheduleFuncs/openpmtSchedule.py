# Open PMT Balance Schedule Node

This node creates a comprehensive schedule displaying the total outstanding payments (principal + interest) remaining from each period until the end of the loan repayment timeframe. This schedule shows how the remaining payment obligation decreases over time as payments are made, providing insight into the future cash flow requirements at any point during the loan term.

## Input Requirements

The input table must contain the following loan parameters:

1. **Annual rate column**: Annual interest rate in decimal format (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
2. **Number of periods column**: Total number of payment periods (integer or decimal)
3. **Present value column**: Principal loan amount or present value (monetary amount)

## Configuration Parameters

**Annual Rate Column**: Select the column containing the annual interest rate in decimal format. This rate will be automatically converted to the appropriate periodic rate based on the selected payment frequency.

**Number of Periods Column**: Select the column containing the total number of payment periods for the complete loan term.

**Present Value Column**: Select the column containing the loan principal amount or present value.

**Payment Frequency**: Choose the frequency of loan payments. Monthly payments occur 12 times per year and are most common for mortgages and personal loans. Quarterly payments occur 4 times per year and are common for business loans. Annual payments occur once per year and are typical for some commercial loans.

**Interest Type**: Select the method for calculating periodic interest rates. Simple interest uses the formula: Periodic rate = Annual rate รท Payment frequency. Compound interest uses the formula: Periodic rate = (1 + Annual rate)^(1/Payment frequency) - 1.

**Payment Timing**: Configure when payments are due within each period. Set to `0` for payments due at end of each period (ordinary annuity), which is the default. Set to `1` for payments due at beginning of each period (annuity due).

## Output Structure

The node generates a detailed outstanding payments schedule with these columns:

**Original Input Columns**: All columns from the input table are preserved for reference

**Period**: Sequential period numbers from 1 to the total number of payment periods

**Outstanding_Payments**: Total payments remaining to be made from the current period through the final loan payment, showing the decreasing future payment obligation over time
